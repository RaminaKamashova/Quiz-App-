# Quiz-App-

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ It seems that formatting a `README` isnâ€™t my strong suit.. 
Hereâ€™s what youâ€™ll find in this file:


- **`index.html`**: The main HTML file that sets up the structure of the quiz.
- **`style.css`**: The CSS file for styling the quiz and making it visually appealing.
- **`script.js`**: The JavaScript file that handles fetching quiz data, displaying questions, checking answers, and managing user interactions.
- **`data.json`**: A JSON file containing quiz questions, options, and correct answers.

PS: This project uses the `fetch` API to load quiz data from the `data.json` file.
